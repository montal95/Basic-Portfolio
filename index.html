        <p>I am Sam Montalvo Jr. I am up-and-coming web designer in the DFW area. I originally went to school at the University of North Texas and graduated with a bachelors in Psychology. I currently live in Denton and spend my weekends on racing sailboats and going camping. </p>
        <p>I used to work in an online sailing store doing basic HTML and CSS for the website and doing technical calls and sales. I hope to be able to go further in the web design field and be able to do back end work as well as picking up a couple languages along the way.</p>
